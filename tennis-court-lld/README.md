# Tennis Court Booking System - Low Level Design

A comprehensive tennis court booking system that efficiently assigns bookings to courts using minimum resources. This implementation covers all aspects of the classic "Expanding Tennis Club" interview question.

## üìã Problem Statement

Design a system for a tennis club that:
- Assigns bookings to specific courts
- Uses the minimum number of courts
- Handles maintenance requirements
- Detects booking conflicts

## üéØ Interview Question Parts Covered

### Part (a): Basic Court Assignment
Implement a function that assigns bookings to courts using minimum number of courts.

**Function Signature:**
```java
List<Court> assignCourts(List<BookingRecord> bookingRecords)
```

**Algorithm:** Greedy approach with min-heap
- Sort bookings by start time
- Use priority queue to track court availability
- Assign to earliest available court or create new court

**Time Complexity:** O(N log N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(K) where K = number of courts

### Part (b): Fixed Maintenance Time
After each booking, a fixed maintenance time X is needed before the court can be used again.

**Function Signature:**
```java
List<Court> assignCourtsWithMaintenance(
    List<BookingRecord> bookingRecords, 
    int maintenanceTime)
```

### Part (c): Periodic Maintenance
Courts need maintenance after X bookings (durability).

**Function Signature:**
```java
List<Court> assignCourtsWithPeriodicMaintenance(
    List<BookingRecord> bookingRecords,
    int maintenanceTime,
    int durability)
```

**Features:**
- Tracks usage count per court
- Schedules maintenance after durability threshold
- Adds maintenance time to court availability

### Part (d): Minimum Courts Needed (Simplified)
Find minimum number of courts without assigning to specific courts.

**Function Signature:**
```java
int findMinimumCourtsNeeded(List<BookingRecord> bookingRecords)
```

**Algorithm:** Interval scheduling with event sweep
- Create START and END events for each booking
- Sort events by time
- Count maximum concurrent bookings

**Time Complexity:** O(N log N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(N)

### Part (e): Conflict Detection
Check if two bookings conflict with each other.

**Function Signature:**
```java
boolean checkBookingConflict(BookingRecord booking1, BookingRecord booking2)
```

**Logic:** Two bookings conflict if they overlap in time
- No conflict if: `booking1.finish <= booking2.start OR booking2.finish <= booking1.start`
- Conflict otherwise

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Classes

#### 1. **BookingRecord**
Represents a tennis court booking.

```java
class BookingRecord {
    int id;
    int startTime;
    int finishTime;
    
    boolean conflictsWith(BookingRecord other);
    boolean conflictsWithMaintenance(BookingRecord other, int maintenanceTime);
}
```

#### 2. **Court**
Represents a tennis court with assigned bookings.

```java
class Court {
    int courtId;
    List<BookingRecord> bookings;
    int availableFrom;
    int usageCount;
    int nextMaintenanceAt;
    
    boolean canAccommodate(BookingRecord booking);
    void assignBooking(BookingRecord booking);
    void performMaintenance(int maintenanceTime, int durability);
}
```

#### 3. **CourtAssignmentSystem**
Main system for court assignment algorithms.

```java
class CourtAssignmentSystem {
    List<Court> assignCourts(List<BookingRecord> bookings);
    List<Court> assignCourtsWithMaintenance(List<BookingRecord> bookings, int maintenanceTime);
    List<Court> assignCourtsWithPeriodicMaintenance(...);
    int findMinimumCourtsNeeded(List<BookingRecord> bookings);
    boolean checkBookingConflict(BookingRecord b1, BookingRecord b2);
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Court Assignment
```java
CourtAssignmentSystem system = new CourtAssignmentSystem();

List<BookingRecord> bookings = Arrays.asList(
    new BookingRecord(1, 0, 60),
    new BookingRecord(2, 30, 90),
    new BookingRecord(3, 60, 120)
);

List<Court> courts = system.assignCourts(bookings);
System.out.println("Courts needed: " + courts.size()); // 2
```

### With Maintenance Time
```java
List<Court> courts = system.assignCourtsWithMaintenance(bookings, 10);
// Each court needs 10 minutes maintenance after each booking
```

### Minimum Courts Calculation
```java
int minCourts = system.findMinimumCourtsNeeded(bookings);
System.out.println("Minimum courts: " + minCourts);
```

### Conflict Detection
```java
BookingRecord b1 = new BookingRecord(1, 0, 60);
BookingRecord b2 = new BookingRecord(2, 30, 90);

boolean conflict = system.checkBookingConflict(b1, b2);
System.out.println("Conflict: " + conflict); // true
```

## üßÆ Algorithm Details

### Greedy Court Assignment (Part a, b, c)

**Key Insight:** Always assign booking to the earliest available court.

**Steps:**
1. Sort bookings by start time: O(N log N)
2. Maintain min-heap of courts ordered by availability: O(log K) per operation
3. For each booking:
   - Check if earliest available court can accommodate
   - If yes, assign to that court
   - If no, create new court
4. Update court availability after assignment

**Why it works:** 
- Greedy choice is optimal for interval scheduling
- Using earliest available court minimizes total courts needed
- Min-heap ensures efficient court selection

### Event Sweep Algorithm (Part d)

**Key Insight:** Maximum concurrent bookings = minimum courts needed.

**Steps:**
1. Create START and END events for each booking
2. Sort events by time (END before START at same time)
3. Sweep through events:
   - START event: increment counter
   - END event: decrement counter
4. Track maximum counter value

**Example:**
```
Bookings: [0-60], [30-90], [45-105]

Events: START(0), START(30), START(45), END(60), END(90), END(105)

Counter: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0
                      ^
                   Max = 3 courts needed
```

## üìä Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Basic Assignment | O(N log N) | O(K) |
| With Maintenance | O(N log N) | O(K) |
| Periodic Maintenance | O(N log N) | O(K) |
| Minimum Courts | O(N log N) | O(N) |
| Conflict Check | O(1) | O(1) |

Where:
- N = number of bookings
- K = number of courts needed

## üéì Interview Tips

### Key Points to Mention

1. **Algorithm Choice:**
   - "I'll use a greedy approach with a min-heap for optimal court assignment"
   - "The key insight is that assigning to the earliest available court is optimal"

2. **Time Complexity:**
   - "Sorting takes O(N log N)"
   - "Each heap operation is O(log K)"
   - "Overall: O(N log N)"

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty booking list
   - Single booking
   - All bookings overlap
   - Bookings at same time
   - Maintenance time = 0

4. **Follow-up Questions:**
   - "How would you handle booking cancellations?" ‚Üí Remove from court, update availability
   - "What if courts have different costs?" ‚Üí Use cost-aware priority queue
   - "How to handle booking priorities?" ‚Üí Sort by priority first, then time

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå Not sorting bookings by start time  
‚ùå Using O(N¬≤) brute force approach  
‚ùå Not handling edge cases (empty list, null)  
‚ùå Forgetting to add maintenance time to availability  
‚ùå Incorrect conflict detection logic  

‚úÖ Sort bookings first  
‚úÖ Use min-heap for efficiency  
‚úÖ Handle all edge cases  
‚úÖ Track court state properly  
‚úÖ Test with various scenarios
